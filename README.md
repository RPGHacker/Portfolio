Portfolio of Markus Wall
========================

Welcome to my Portfolio! This Github repository is a collection of some of my personal projects, including full source code.


Project List
------------

**Kokku Engine (WIP)**

A base engine for a 2D platformer inspired by Mario games, developed in Unreal Engine 4.4.0. Very early WIP.

**A Star**

A grid-based implementation of A* path finding algorithm, written in C# for fun. Also uses multi-threading to prevent the game from freezing while a path is being searched. Requires [XNA to be installed on your system](https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230).

**3D Renderer Interface**

Basic framework for a 3D rendering interface written in C++ that loads its actual renderer from a dynamic library. Currently does nothing but clearing the screen to a certain color, but already supports Direct X 10 and Direct X 11 renderers and is built with multi-platform support in mind.

**Quad Trees**

A simple quad tree implementation written in C#. Generates random sprites, adds them to a quad tree and then queries all sprites from the quad tree intersecting with a circle controlled by the mouse. Requires [XNA to be installed on your system](https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230).

**Simple Matrix Library**

A simple matrix library written in C#. Supports calculations like inverse, coefficient and determinant. Also includes some simple 2D vector code.
