Portfolio of Markus Wall
========================

Welcome to my Portfolio! This Github repository is a collection of some of my personal projects, including full source code.

**NOTE:** This repository is updated rarely and a lot of my work on here is outdated. Most of my more recent code is still private, but shall be made public once it progresses far enough.


Project List
------------

**Custom Calendar (2016)**

A calendar application requested by a friend. It works similar to the Windows calendar, but can be customized in many different ways. Months, week days, leap days and more things can be changed. The application also automatically saves all settings.

**Kokku Engine (WIP) (2014)**

A base engine for a 2D platformer inspired by Mario games, developed in Unreal Engine 4.4.0. Very early WIP.

**A Star (2014)**

A grid-based implementation of A* path finding algorithm, written in C# for fun. Also uses multi-threading to prevent the game from freezing while a path is being searched. Requires [XNA to be installed on your system](https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230).

**3D Renderer Interface (2014)**

Basic framework for a 3D rendering interface written in C++ that loads its actual renderer from a dynamic library. Currently does nothing but clearing the screen to a certain color, but already supports Direct X 10 and Direct X 11 renderers and is built with multi-platform support in mind.

**Quad Trees (2014)**

A simple quad tree implementation written in C#. Generates random sprites, adds them to a quad tree and then queries all sprites from the quad tree intersecting with a circle controlled by the mouse. Requires [XNA to be installed on your system](https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230).

**Simple Matrix Library (2014)**

A simple matrix library written in C#. Supports calculations like inverse, coefficient and determinant. Also includes some simple 2D vector code.
